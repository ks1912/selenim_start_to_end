In Java, data types specify the type of data that a variable can hold. They determine the size and type of values that can be stored in a variable. Java has two categories of data types: primitive data types and reference data types.

### Primitive Data Types:

1. **Numeric Types:**

   - `byte`: 8-bit signed integer (-128 to 127)
   - `short`: 16-bit signed integer (-32,768 to 32,767)
   - `int`: 32-bit signed integer (-2^31 to 2^31-1)
   - `long`: 64-bit signed integer (-2^63 to 2^63-1)
   - `float`: 32-bit floating point (single precision)
   - `double`: 64-bit floating point (double precision)

2. **Characters:**

   - `char`: 16-bit Unicode character (0 to 65,535)

3. **Boolean:**
   - `boolean`: Represents true or false values.

### Reference Data Types:

Reference data types are objects that are created from classes. They include:

- **Class Types:** Created from user-defined classes.
- **Array Types:** Arrays that hold multiple values of the same type.

### Variables:

Variables are named containers used to store data values. Before using a variable, it needs to be declared with a data type. Variables also need to be initialized before they can be used.

For example:

```java
int number; // Declaration
number = 5; // Initialization

double temperature = 98.6; // Declaration and initialization in one line

String message = "Hello, World!"; // Reference data type (String)
```

Variables in Java have certain naming rules:

- They must begin with a letter (A-Z or a-z), dollar sign ($), or underscore (\_).
- They can be followed by letters (A-Z or a-z), digits (0-9), dollar signs ($), or underscores (\_).
- They cannot be a Java keyword.
- Variable names are case-sensitive.

Understanding data types and variables is crucial in Java programming, as they define how data is stored and manipulated within a program.
